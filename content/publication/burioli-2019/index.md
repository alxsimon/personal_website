abstract: "Marine mussel production is of substantial economic interest in numerous coastal areas worldwide, making crucial the study of pathologies that affect them. Disseminated neoplasia (DN) has recently been suggested to be linked to blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, mortality outbreaks observed in France since 2014, although the evidence remains indirect. In order to improve DN detection and monitoring, we compared the sensitivity of four diagnostic tools, namely haemocytology, histology, flow cytometry, and genetics. Haemocytological examination gave the best results in sensitivity and had the advantage of being non-invasive, allowing disease progression to be followed in affected mussels. Using this approach, we showed that DN progression is usually slow, and we provide evidence of remission events. We observed a high diversity of forms and mitotic features of neoplastic cells located in the vesicular connective tissue but rarely in the haemolymph. Circulating cells occur as four main types but are homogenous in morphology and DNA content within a single individual. Polyploidy proved very high, from 8 N to 18 N. Genetic analysis of haemolymph DNA showed that a Mytilus trossulus genetic signal was associated with almost all the DN cases here diagnosed by haemocytological examination, regardless of the DN type. This result corroborates DN is a transmissible cancer that first originated in a M. trossulus host and subsequently crossed into M. edulis. No pre-neoplastic conditions were detectable. The prevalence of the disease was quite low, which, together with the low morbidity observed in the lab, suggest DN is unlikely to be the direct cause of mortality outbreaks in France."
