Disseminated neoplasia (DN) has recently been suggested to be linked to blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, mortality outbreaks observed in France since 2014, although the evidence remains indirect. In order to improve DN detection and monitoring, we compared the sensitivity of four diagnostic tools, namely haemocytology, histology, flow cytometry, and genetics. Haemocytological examination gave the best results in sensitivity and had the advantage of being non-invasive, allowing disease progression to be followed in affected mussels. Using this approach, we showed that DN progression is usually slow, and we provide evidence of remission events. We observed a high diversity of forms and mitotic features of neoplastic cells located in the vesicular connective tissue but rarely in the haemolymph. Circulating cells occur as four main types but are homogenous in morphology and DNA content within a single individual. Polyploidy proved very high, from 8 N to 18 N. Genetic analysis of haemolymph DNA showed that a Mytilus trossulus genetic signal was associated with almost all the DN cases here diagnosed by haemocytological examination, regardless of the DN type. This result corroborates DN is a transmissible cancer that first originated in a M. trossulus host and subsequently crossed into M. edulis. No pre-neoplastic conditions were detectable. The prevalence of the disease was quite low, which, together with the low morbidity observed in the lab, suggest DN is unlikely to be the direct cause of mortality outbreaks in France.","tags":null,"title":"Implementation of Various Approaches to Study the Prevalence, Incidence and Progression of Disseminated Neoplasia in Mussel Stocks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexis Simon","Christelle Fraïsse","Tahani El Ayari","Cathy Liautard-Haag","Petr Strelkov","John J.

When similar introductions occur in different places, they provide replicated large-scale hybridisation experiments. We studied the population genetics of Mytilus mussels in several M. galloprovincialis introduction areas. Using a dataset of 4279 mussels, genotyped at 77 ancestry informative markers, we document the introduction of the Mediterranean lineage of M. galloprovincialis to five ports in France and of the Atlantic lineage in Norway. In each case, the introduced species has extensively admixed with M. edulis. In Ports, we also observed sharp genetic shifts, at a very fine spatial scale, at the open sea-port interface, where the seaward native population is M. edulis. The sole exception was the bay of Brest, where the native population is the Atlantic lineage of M. galloprovincialis, and where the invading mussels started to spread and admix with the native background. Sharp transitions at the port entrance, at scales below the dispersal distance, do not fit well with the predictions of a migration-selection tension zone model, and instead suggest habitat choice and adaptation to the environment of the port, possibly coupled with connectivity barriers. We then examined departures from the average admixture rate at different loci (i.e., Barton’s concordance). We compared the two human-mediated admixture events (French ports and Norway), to naturally admixed populations, and to transmission ratio distortions observed in experimental lab crosses. When the same M. galloprovincialis background was involved, we found positive correlations in the departures of marker loci in the different locations; but when different M. galloprovincialis backgrounds were involved, we found no or negative correlations. Some of the positive correlations we observed are best explained by a shared history during saltatory colonisation, but some independent replicates imply parallel selective processes, suggesting that the genome-wide effect of admixture is highly repeatable.","tags":null,"title":"Replicated Anthropogenic Hybridisations Reveal Parallel Patterns of Admixture in Marine Mussels","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Claudia Junge","Stephen C.

However, there is insufficient knowledge about population structure at different spatial scales necessary to optimise fisheries models. We used single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained through complexityreduction genome sequencing to quantify the population structure of two highly mobile and commercially fished shark species: bronze whalers (Carcharhinus brachyurus) and dusky sharks (C. obscurus). We applied a comprehensive approach to test several population-structure hypotheses and signal consistency across methods and marker type. We found that C. obscurus was panmictic across Australia and Indonesia and across the Indian Ocean to South Africa based on neutral loci, whereas for C. brachyurus, the westernmost Australian samples appeared to be separate from the rest. The southernmost east Australian samples indicated some difference from the rest of Australia and New Zealand based on candidate loci for C. brachyurus, and potentially also C. obscurus; however, the lack of a reference genome makes the interpretation difficult. Despite similar patterns in both species, subtle and potentially important structure differences emphasise the importance of studying each target species independently rather than assuming similar patterns from closely related species with similar dispersal abilities, as well as considering different marker types in future studies. We found evidence of connectivity across the regions sampled, suggesting that the cumulative effects of regional fisheries and the potential for cross-jurisdictional fishery assessments and management should be considered for Australian, Indonesian, and New Zealand populations.","tags":null,"title":"Comparative Population Genomics Confirms Little Population Structure in Two Commercially Targeted Carcharhinid Sharks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexis Simon","Nicolas Bierne","John J.
